## Introduction

This software automatically creates beautiful slideshows from iNaturalist bioblitz observations. It's **fully customizable for any bioblitz project worldwide** - just configure a few settings and you're ready to go.

The software downloads photos, creates custom maps showing where each observation was made, and assembles everything into a professional slideshow presentation.

The slideshow includes:
- Random selection of observations with biodiversity diversity controls
- Customizable maps (satellite imagery, street maps, or topographic)
- Organized by iconic taxon groups (Plants, Insects, Birds, etc.)
- Auto-advancing slides perfect for display at events
- Multiple output formats (HTML, QMD, and PDF)
- Your bioblitz name and year on welcome slides

**Who is this guide for?** Anyone who wants to create a slideshow from an iNaturalist bioblitz, regardless of technical expertise or R experience.

**New in Version 3.0:**
- **Interactive Shiny GUI App** - No code editing required!
- **Two usage methods** - Choose GUI or traditional R script
- Real-time progress monitoring with colorful indicators (🔭👥📷🗺️🎬)
- Enhanced caching and incremental updates
- Save and load configurations

- ✅ Are less comfortable editing R scripts

**Advantages:**
- No code editing required - all settings in user-friendly forms
- Live progress tracking with colorful emoji indicators
- Save/load configurations for repeated use
- See observation counts and file creation in real-time
- Quick-access buttons to open outputs
- Built-in help text for every option
- Perfect for event displays where you need frequent updates

**File:** `bioblitz_shiny_app_FINAL.R`

---

### 📝 Method 2: Traditional R Script

**Use this if you:**
- ✅ Are comfortable editing R code
- ✅ Want maximum control over parameters
- ✅ Need to integrate into automated workflows
- ✅ Prefer version-controlling your settings
- ✅ Want to run from command line
- ✅ Don't need a GUI

**Advantages:**
- Complete control over every parameter
- Can be automated or scheduled
- Easier to version control settings
- No GUI overhead
- Can be modified or extended
- Simpler for one-time use

**File:** `iNaturalist_Bioblitz_Slideshow_Generator.R`

---

**Can't decide?** Try the Shiny GUI first! It's easier to learn and you can always switch to the script method later for more advanced needs.

## What This Software Does

### The Process

Both methods use the same underlying slideshow generation engine:

1. **Connects to iNaturalist**: Downloads observation data from your specified project
2. **Smart Sampling**: Randomly selects observations while ensuring diversity:
   - Limits how many photos from each observer (prevents one person dominating)
   - Controls plant vs. animal ratio
   - Ensures representation across different species groups
3. **Downloads Photos**: Gets high-quality images of each selected observation
4. **Creates Custom Maps**: For each observation, generates a map showing:
   - The observation location (marked with a red star)
   - Your bioblitz headquarters (marked with "HQ")
   - Optional roads (in gold) and waterways (in blue) for context
   - Scale bar for distance reference
   - **Configurable base map**: Choose satellite imagery, street maps, or topographic
5. **Composes Slides**: Combines photos with maps side-by-side, adds species names and observer credits
6. **Builds Slideshow**: Creates a professional presentation organized by organism type
7. **Generates Outputs**: Produces HTML (for viewing), QMD (for editing), and optionally PDF versions

### Key Features

- **Truly Random**: Every run selects different photos (perfect for daily displays)
- **Diversity Controls**: Ensures fair representation across observers and taxa
- **Efficient Caching**: After the first run, only checks for new observations (much faster!)
- **Location Maps**: Each photo is paired with a satellite map, roads and waterways, and a legend that includes your bioblitz HQ. The focal record shows as a white X, with an option to add faint grey dots for other nearby records of the same species.
- **Plays Offline**: reveal.js is bundled beside the HTML on the first run, so the finished slideshow plays without an internet connection.
- **Automatic Dates**: the date range on the welcome slide is read from the observations (or set by hand).
- **High Resolution Photos**: Automatically downloads full-size images, not thumbnails
- **Fully Customizable**: Your bioblitz name (the year is appended automatically) and extensive configuration options
- **Real-Time Monitoring** (GUI only): Watch progress with live updates

  - Range: 5-100

---

#### 6. Run Mode & Performance ⚠️ IMPORTANT

**What it is:** Determines how the script handles existing files and data.

**Settings:**

- **Fresh Run (Delete Old Artifacts)**
  - ✅ **Checked** (Fresh Run):
    - Deletes all previous output files
    - Re-downloads all observations from iNaturalist
    - Use for first run or complete refresh
  
  - ❌ **Unchecked** (Incremental Update):
    - Keeps existing cached data
    - Only identifies new observations since last run
    - Much faster for daily updates
    - Reuses previously downloaded photos/maps where possible

- **Fetch All Observations**
  - Usually keep checked
  - Uncheck only for testing with small subset

- **Cache Observations**
  - Keep checked!
  - Saves observation data for faster reruns

- **Use Incremental Fetch**
  - Only active when "Fresh Run" is unchecked
  - Fetches only NEW observations since last run
  - Essential for daily updates
  - Much faster than re-fetching everything

**💡 Important Usage Pattern:**

**First Run:**
- ✅ Check "Fresh Run"
- Generate your slideshow
- Click "Save Configuration"

**Daily Updates:**
- ❌ Uncheck "Fresh Run"
- ✅ Check "Use Incremental Fetch"
- Click "Generate Slideshow"
- Only processes new observations!

---

#### 7. Advanced Options

**What it is:** Fine control over map regeneration.

**Settings:**

- **Force Rebuild Base Map**
  - Regenerates the background map
  - Usually check this for first run
  - Uncheck after first run for speed

- **Force Rebuild All Maps**
  - Regenerates individual observation maps
  - Uncheck for faster reruns

- **Force Rebuild All Slides**
  - Regenerates all slide images
  - Uncheck for faster reruns

- **Skip OpenStreetMap Overlays (Faster)**
  - Skips roads and waterways
  - Much faster for large areas
  - Check if maps are slow

**💡 Tip:** After your first successful run, uncheck "Force Rebuild" options for much faster updates!

---

#### 8. PDF Output Settings

**What it is:** Optional PDF version of your slideshow.

**Settings:**

- **Create PDF Version**
  - Requires Chrome/Chromium installed
  - Can be very slow for large slideshows
  - Creates a shareable PDF file

- **PDF Size Limit (MB)**
  - Skip PDF creation if it would exceed this size
  - 0 = no limit (may create huge files!)
  - 50 MB recommended

**💡 Tip:** Disable PDF creation for 100+ photo slideshows to save time.

---

#### 9. Random Seed (Reproducibility)

**What it is:** Controls randomness in observation selection.

**Settings:**

- **Use Random Selection**
  - ✅ Checked: Different photos every run (recommended)
  - ❌ Unchecked: Uses R's current random state

- **Specific Random Seed** (optional)
  - Leave blank for true randomness
  - Enter a number (e.g., 12345) to get the exact same photos every time
  - Useful for testing or creating reproducible slideshows

#### 2. Open in RStudio

- File → Open File
- Navigate to the script
- Click Open

#### 3. Find the Configuration Section

Scroll down to around **line 50** where you'll see:

```r
# ==============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
```

This is where you'll customize all the settings.

---

### Understanding the Configuration

The configuration section has comments explaining each setting. Here are the key ones:

#### Essential Settings

```r
# iNaturalist project identifier (from project URL)
project_slug <- "walpole-wilderness-bioblitz-2025"

# How many photos to include in the slideshow
# (the script may ship set low, e.g. 3, for a quick test; raise it for a full show)
n_photos <- 50

# For the welcome slide. The year is appended automatically from the data,
# e.g. "Walpole Wilderness Bioblitz 2025".
bioblitz_name <- "Walpole Wilderness Bioblitz"

# Optional: logo file (JPG or PNG) in the project root folder
bioblitz_logo <- "walpole_bioblitz_logo.jpg"

# Date range on the welcome slide: read from the data, or set by hand
bioblitz_dates_auto  <- TRUE
bioblitz_dates_start <- NULL   # e.g. "2025-11-15", used only when bioblitz_dates_auto = FALSE
bioblitz_dates_end   <- NULL   # e.g. "2025-11-17"
```

**Finding your project slug:**
1. Go to your iNaturalist project page
2. Look at URL: `https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/YOUR-PROJECT-SLUG`
3. Copy everything after `/projects/`

#### Location Settings

```r
# Coordinates of your bioblitz headquarters
hq_lon <- 116.634398   # Longitude (E/W)
hq_lat <- -34.992854   # Latitude (N/S)

# Map settings
base_map_zoom   <- 14    # Satellite zoom, 13-15 typical (higher = more detail, slower)
default_dist_m  <- 4000  # Minimum map half-width (m): the closest/most-zoomed-in level
map_zoom_n      <- 4     # Discrete zoom levels; each map snaps to the smallest that
                         # still frames both HQ and the observation
map_pad_m       <- 1000  # Margin (m) kept between HQ/observation and the window edge
map_margin_frac <- 0.20  # Fractional edge margin (0-0.4); higher = slightly more zoomed out
show_conspecific_dots <- TRUE  # Also show other in-view records of the same species as faint grey dots
```

**Finding your coordinates:**
1. Open Google Maps
2. Right-click your HQ location
3. Click the coordinates to copy
4. First number is longitude, second is latitude

#### Diversity Controls

```r
# Ensure fair representation
max_obs_per_observer_pct <- 0.15  # Max 15% from any one observer
max_obs_per_observer_abs <- 5     # Hard limit: max 5 per observer
max_plants_pct <- 0.40             # Max 40% plants (balance taxonomy)
```

#### Satellite Imagery and Overlays

The maps use Esri World Imagery (satellite) with OpenStreetMap roads and
waterways drawn on top. To speed things up on a large or slow area, drop the
overlays and/or lower the zoom:

```r
skip_osm_overlays <- TRUE   # Skip the OSM roads/waterways overlay (faster)
base_map_zoom     <- 12     # Lower zoom = fewer tiles = faster
```

#### Run Modes

**Fresh run** (first time or complete refresh):
```r
fresh_run <- TRUE                   # Delete old files
fetch_all_observations <- TRUE      # Download all observations
cache_observations <- TRUE          # Save for next time
```

**Incremental update** (daily bioblitz):
```r
fresh_run <- FALSE                  # Keep existing files
use_incremental_fetch <- TRUE       # Only new observations
cache_observations <- TRUE          # Update cache
```

#### Slideshow Settings

```r
auto_advance_ms      <- 7000   # 7 seconds per slide
auto_slide_stoppable <- TRUE   # Allow manual control
slideshow_loop       <- TRUE   # Loop at the end (good for unattended displays)
vendor_revealjs      <- TRUE   # Bundle reveal.js locally so the show plays offline
max_collage          <- 25     # Photos in the final collage
```

#### PDF Settings

```r
create_pdf <- TRUE             # Generate PDF version (requires Chrome)
pdf_size_limit_mb <- 50        # Skip if PDF would be larger than this
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (Both Methods)

#### "Cannot connect to iNaturalist"

**Causes:**
- No internet connection
- iNaturalist API is down
- Incorrect project slug

**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Try accessing iNaturalist.org in browser
- Verify project slug is correct
- Wait and try again (API may be temporarily down)

---

#### "No observations found"

**Causes:**
- Project has no observations yet
- Project has no observations with photos
- Incorrect project slug
- Date filters excluding all observations

**Solutions:**
- Verify project has observations with photos on iNaturalist
- Double-check project slug
- Ensure `fetch_all_observations <- TRUE` (or checked in GUI)
- Remove any date filters

---

#### "Script is very slow"

**Causes:**
- Large bioblitz area with detailed maps
- High zoom level
- Satellite imagery provider
- Many observations

**Solutions:**

**Quick fixes (GUI):**
- Change to "OpenStreetMap" provider (script only)
- Check "Skip OpenStreetMap Overlays"
- Reduce "Base Map Zoom Level" to 12-13
- Reduce "Map Buffer" to 2-3 km

**Quick fixes (Script):**
```r
skip_osm_overlays <- TRUE
base_map_zoom     <- 12
```

These can make maps 10-20x faster!

---

#### Package Installation Fails

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: package 'xyz' is not available
```

**Solutions:**
1. Update R to latest version
2. Update RStudio to latest version
3. Try manual installation:
   ```r
   install.packages("package_name")
   ```
4. Check Console for specific errors
5. Install dependencies first:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("terra", "sf", "ggplot2"))
   ```

---

### Shiny App Specific Issues

#### "Cannot find script file"

**Error message:**
```
ERROR: Cannot find 'Final_Walpole_Bioblitz_Slideshow_Script.R'
```

**Solution:**
1. Configuration Tab → Script Location
2. Enter correct filename
3. Ensure script is in same folder as Shiny app
4. Check Current directory in Console

---

#### Progress Indicators Stuck at Zero

**Symptoms:**
- Counters show 0
- Status shows "Running"
- Time passes with no updates

**Solutions:**
1. Click "Refresh File Counts" button
2. Check "Live Progress Log" for errors
3. Wait - initialization can take 2-3 minutes
4. Look in output folder to see if files are being created

---

#### "Process may still be running"

**When it happens:**
- After closing app window
- After clicking Stop

**Solution:**
- Reopen app
- Click "Stop Process" again
- Or check Task Manager (Windows) / Activity Monitor (Mac) for R processes
- Kill any orphaned Rscript processes

---

#### App Freezes or Becomes Unresponsive

**What's happening:**
- App interface may freeze while script runs
- This is normal - background process is working

**What to do:**
- **Don't close the browser/window**
- Check Live Progress Log (may still update)
- Check output folder for new files
- Wait for completion
- Background process runs separately from GUI

---

### Script-Specific Issues

#### "Object not found" errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: object 'xyz' not found
```

**Causes:**
- Ran partial script
- Skipped package loading section
- Variable name typo in configuration

**Solutions:**
- Always run from beginning (click Source)
- Never skip the package loading section
- Check variable names match exactly

---

#### "Fresh run vs incremental confusion"

**Problem:**
- Incremental run takes too long
- Fresh run doesn't find observations

**Understanding Fresh Run:**
- ✅ Checked: Deletes everything, starts over
- Use for first run or when you want to completely refresh

**Understanding Incremental:**
- ❌ Unchecked: Keeps cache, only fetches new observations
- Requires `use_incremental_fetch <- TRUE`
- Much faster for daily updates
- Needs cache from previous run

---

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Multi-Day Bioblitz Events

**Day 1:**
- Use Fresh Run
- Generate 50-photo slideshow
- Enable Loop
- Set auto-advance to 10 seconds
- Display on large screen at registration

**Days 2-7:**
- Use Incremental Update
- Keep same settings
- Regenerate each morning
- Updates only take 3-5 minutes!

---

### For Presentations

**Settings:**
- 25-50 photos
- Auto-advance: 7 seconds
- Don't loop
- Create PDF for sharing

**Presenting:**
- Press F for fullscreen
- Press Space to advance manually (overrides auto-advance)
- Press ESC to exit

---

### For Social Media

**Create short version:**
- 10-15 photos
- Create PDF
- Extract favorite slides as images
- Share slideshow.html link

---

### Optimizing Performance

**For FAST slideshow generation:**

```r
# In script:
skip_osm_overlays <- TRUE
base_map_zoom     <- 12
create_pdf        <- FALSE
```

**In GUI:**
- Advanced Options → Check "Skip OpenStreetMap Overlays"
- Location Settings → Base Map Zoom Level: 12
- Location Settings → Map Buffer: 2 km
- PDF Output Settings → Uncheck "Create PDF"

**Trade-off:** Faster generation, less detailed maps

---

### Ensuring Diversity

**Problem:** One observer dominates slideshow

**Solution:**
```r
max_obs_per_observer_abs <- 3
# Or in GUI: Diversity Settings → Absolute Max: 3
```

**Problem:** Too many plant photos

**Solution:**
```r
max_plants_pct <- 0.30  # Max 30%
# Or in GUI: Diversity Settings → Max % Plant Photos: 30%
```

---

### Reproducing Exact Results

**Want same photos every time?**

```r
# In script:
use_random_seed <- TRUE
random_seed <- 42  # Any number

# In GUI:
# Random Seed → Check "Use Random Selection"
# Specific Random Seed: 42
```

Every run with seed 42 will select the same observations!

---

### Managing Disk Space

Slideshows can get large:
- 25 photos: ~500 MB
- 50 photos: ~1 GB
- 100 photos: ~2 GB

**To save space:**
- Delete old output folders when done
- Disable PDF for large slideshows
- Reduce `base_map_zoom` (smaller map files)

---

## Advanced Topics

### Customizing the Slideshow

Edit `slideshow.qmd` in RStudio:

**Change title slide:**
```yaml
title: "Your Custom Title"
subtitle: "Your Subtitle"
```

**Change colors:**
```css
.reveal h1 { color: #yourcolor; }
```

**Add extra slides:**
Add between observation slides in QMD file

**Reorder slides:**
Cut and paste slide sections

**Re-render:**
```r
quarto::quarto_render("outputs/slideshow/slideshow.qmd")
```

---

### Automating Daily Updates

**Windows Task Scheduler:**
1. Create `run_daily.bat`:
   ```batch
   "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.x.x\bin\Rscript.exe" "C:\path\to\script.R"
   ```
2. Schedule in Task Scheduler
3. Runs automatically each morning

**Mac/Linux Cron:**
1. Edit crontab: `crontab -e`
2. Add line:
   ```
   0 8 * * * Rscript /path/to/script.R
   ```
3. Runs at 8 AM daily

---

### Map Imagery

The slideshow uses Esri World Imagery (satellite) for every map, with
OpenStreetMap roads and waterways as overlays. There is no map-provider
switch; to lighten or speed up the maps, use `skip_osm_overlays` and a lower
`base_map_zoom` (see Optimizing Performance).

---

### Multiple Output Versions

Want different versions for different audiences?

**Create multiple configurations:**

**Script method:**
```r
# Save different script versions:
# script_presentation.R (25 photos, no loop)
# script_display.R (50 photos, loop, fast maps)
# script_comprehensive.R (100 photos, detailed maps)
```

**GUI method:**
- Change "Output Directory Name" for each version
- Save configuration after each
- Each gets own output folder

---

### Integrating with Workflows

The script can be part of larger workflows:

**R Markdown reports:**
```r
# In your R Markdown:
source("iNaturalist_Bioblitz_Slideshow_Generator.R")
```

**Shiny apps:**
```r
# Call from your Shiny app:
system("Rscript slideshow_script.R")
```

**API integration:**
- Script already uses iNaturalist API
- Extend to push results elsewhere
- Automate social media posts

---

## Conclusion

You now have two powerful ways to create beautiful bioblitz slideshows:

🖥️ **Shiny GUI App:** Perfect for most users, especially during multi-day events. No code editing required, real-time progress tracking, and easy configuration saving.
